## The Basics Class

### About TBC

The Basics Class or TBC is an initiative by Sachin Sharma to personally teach students in the field of Software Engineering.

Sachin strongly believes that programming skills should be taught in a live manner and by building real-world projects rather than just understanding the syntax and the concepts.

All the courses and workshops are a series of live cohorts, focusing more on building projects and Open source contributions and you get to interact with the instructor whenever you get stuck.
